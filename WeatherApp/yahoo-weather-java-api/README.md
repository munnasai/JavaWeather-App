yahoo-weather-java-api [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fedy2/yahoo-weather-java-api.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fedy2/yahoo-weather-java-api)
======================

**Current version is not working because the yql service by Yahoo has been dismissed (https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/)**

A Java library for the yahoo weather service.

The library is a lightweight wrapper for the Yahoo Weather API (http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/).

The only required dependency is the slf4j-api library.

Usage example:

    YahooWeatherService service = new YahooWeatherService();
    Channel channel = service.getForecast("2502265", DegreeUnit.CELSIUS);
    System.out.println(channel.getDescription());
